## Image Segmentation with UNet

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementing UNet for image segmentation tasks.
UNet is a convolutional neural network architecture that is particularly powerful for biomedical image segmentation, but it can also be adapted for other image segmentation challenges.

## Overview

The notebook provided in this repository demonstrates the setup, training, and evaluation of a UNet model on a sample dataset.
Users can follow the steps to understand how the model processes input images and predicts segmentation masks.

## Notebook Details

- **Data Preparation**:
The notebook includes steps for loading and preprocessing data suitable for input into the UNet model.

- **Model Training**:
Detailed instructions and code for configuring, training, and evaluating the UNet model.

- **Results Visualization**:
Code for visualizing the segmentation results alongside the original images and ground truth masks.
