**Image Segmentation with UNet**
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementing UNet for image segmentation tasks. UNet is a convolutional neural network architecture that is particularly powerful for biomedical image segmentation, but it can also be adapted for other image segmentation challenges.

**Overview**
The notebook provided in this repository demonstrates the setup, training, and evaluation of a UNet model on a sample dataset. Users can follow the steps to understand how the model processes input images and predicts segmentation masks.
